####Coding Advocacy: An Introduction to Quantitative, Visual & Computation Analyses of Supreme Court Oral Arguments & Suggestions for Further Research

>The object of our study, then, is prediction, the prediction of the incidence of the public force through the instrumentality of the courts. 

~ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., *The Path of the Law*, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897).

On March 24, 2014, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in *Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.*, a case presenting the issue of whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which provides that the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion” unless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest, allows a for-profit corporation to deny its employees the health coverage of contraceptives to which the employees are otherwise entitled by federal law, based on the religious objections of the corporation’s owners. For 90 minutes, advocates for two corporations and the government addressed complex legal issues while being peppered with questions from the justices.


Almost immediately after arguments concluded, news organizations across the world summoned their most talented jurisprudential analysts to dissect the arguments and predict how the Court would rule. [According to one SCOTUS prophet](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/25/politics/scotus-obamacare-contraception-mandate/), CNN’s “Supreme Court Producer,” Bill Mears, “[t]he justices appeared divided along ideological lines in a 90-minute oral argument,” and pointed to Justice Kennedy’s “tough questions” to both sides as evidence of his swing voter status.  Despite Mears’ inability to point to any specific questions or exchanges during argument that foretold his predicted outcome, he or some editor boldly titled his piece “Court majority harshly critical of Obamacare contraception mandate.” 

So there you have it! CNN's legal oracles have spoken and it is simply a matter of time before the Court hands down its decision, though it matters not for we already know the outcome. Right? Not exactly . . . [*tout simplement*](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/28/train-wreck-how-the-media-kept-blowing-it-on-obamacare.html), CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin following oral argument in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*: “This was a train wreck for the Obama administration. This law looks like it’s going to be struck down. All of the predictions, including mine, that the justices would not have a problem with this law were wrong.”

Toobin was, of course, wrong . . . *twice*. But we shouldn’t judge Toobin (too harshly). Even the collective wisdom of the masses via [Intrade](http://www.intrade.com/v4/home/) shifted dramatically in favor of the ultimately wrong outcome following oral argument on the issue. [In Nate Silver’s opinion](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/overconfidence-suggested-in-supreme-court-predictions/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1), this phenomenon may have beeen the result of overconfidence in the value of information.  At best, an overvaluing of the information conveyed in oral arguments. At worst, an overvaluing of oral argument in and of themselves.

!(Intrade)[http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/06/27/us/politics/0627-scpredictions/0627-scpredictions-blog480.jpg]

But what if it merely an inability to detect the information? A confusion of noise and signals? Many studies have attempted to address this problem and have conjectured that oral arguments do have some predictive power:

- Epstein, Lee, Landes, William M. and Posner, Richard A. 2009. “Inferring the Winning Party in the Supreme Court from the Pattern of Questioning at Oral Argument.” University of Chicago Law & Economics, Olin Working Paper No. 466. 
- Johnson, Timothy R., Black, Ryan C., Goldman, Jerry and Treul, Sarah. 2009 “Inquiring Minds Want to Know: Do Justices Tip Their Hands with Questions at Oral Argument in the U.S. Supreme Court?”9). Washington University Journal of Law & Policy, Vol. 29, 2009.  
- Shullman, Sarah Levien. 2004. “The Illusion Of Devil’s Advocacy: How The Justices Of The Supreme Court Foreshadow Their Decisions During Oral Argument.” Journal of Appellate Practice and Process. Vol. 6: 2.
- Lindgren, Jim. 2005. “Does Asking More Questions Tip the Outcome of Supreme Court Cases?” Volokh Conspiracy.

Their accuracy, consistency, and comprehensiveness is, however, debatable.
