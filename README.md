Legal Analytics
==========================

###What?

Taught at <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/">Michigan State University College of Law</a>, Legal Analytics is designed to train students to efficiently manage, collect, explore and analyze various forms of legal data. Its purpose is to imbue students with the capability to: (1) understand the process of extracting knowledge from data with specific applications to domains such as legal prediction; (2) distinguish themselves in legal proceedings involving data or analysis; (3) distinguish themselves in firm management matters; (4) understand and communicate with information and software sector clients; and (5) use data to manage outside resources such as LPO or eDiscovery providers. Students will be introduced to sophisticated statistical techniques including machine learning and natural language processing.
